# itto: Your Academic Organization Simplified

## Introduction

Moving to France for college introduced me to a challenging and unfamiliar school system. With constantly changing class schedules, staying organized was a significant hurdle. This inspired me to develop itto, an app crafted to simplify academic organization for students facing similar challenges.

## Features

### Efficient Schedule Management

itto enables users to manage their classes, projects, and exams with ease. Customize your schedule with colors for each class and specify the days they occur. This feature ensures that you're always prepared, making your academic life more manageable.

### Today View

Stay on top of your daily academic requirements with the "today view" feature. Itto reminds you what to review each day, ensuring you're always prepared for your classes and exams. This feature is especially useful for adapting to frequent schedule changes.

### Weekly Updates

Recognizing the dynamic nature of academic schedules, itto prompts users for weekly updates. This allows for the reselection of class days, offering maximum flexibility and ensuring your schedule is always accurate.

### Customizable Timer

A standout feature of itto is its customizable timer, designed to improve time management for studying or working on projects. Coupled with a bar chart report of time spent on each activity, it helps students optimize their study habits for better academic performance.

### Seamless Synchronization

Utilizing CoreData for data storage, itto offers seamless synchronization across all Apple devices. This provides a comprehensive and integrated tool for academic management, ensuring your information is always up-to-date, regardless of the device you're using.

**Voila, this is itto!**
